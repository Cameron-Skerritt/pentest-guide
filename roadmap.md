## 3. Understanding Vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10: Master the most critical web application security risks.
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): Learn about well-known vulnerabilities.
- Exploit Databases: Study real-world exploits from platforms like Exploit-DB.

## 4. Setting Up a Lab
- Virtualization: Use tools like VirtualBox, VMware, or Docker to create isolated environments.
- Vulnerable Applications: Practice on intentionally vulnerable applications (DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, etc.).
- Pentesting OS: Use Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or BackBox for your testing environment.

## 5. Learning Methodologies
- Reconnaissance: Master tools like Nmap, Nikto, and Burp Suite for gathering information.
- Enumeration: Learn to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- Exploitation: Understand how to exploit different types of vulnerabilities.
- Post-Exploitation: Practice techniques to maintain access and escalate privileges.

## 6. Web Application Testing
- Burp Suite: Learn to intercept, manipulate, and replay HTTP requests.
- SQL Injection: Practice on SQL injection challenges and real-world applications.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Learn to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
- CSRF, SSRF, XXE, IDOR: Understand less common but critical vulnerabilities.

## 7. Mobile Application Testing
- Android: Learn about APK reverse engineering, decompiling, and analyzing mobile applications.
- iOS: Study iOS application security and jailbreaking techniques.

## 8. Networking & Infrastructure Testing
- Port Scanning & Fingerprinting: Use Nmap, Masscan, and other tools to discover services.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Automate scans with tools like OpenVAS and Nessus.
- Network Exploits: Practice network-related vulnerabilities like SMB, FTP, and RDP.

## 9. Reporting Vulnerabilities
- Writing Reports: Learn to write clear, concise, and reproducible vulnerability reports.
- Communicating with Vendors: Understand responsible disclosure practices.
- Bug Bounty Platforms: Get familiar with platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and Synack.

## 10. Continuous Learning
- CTF Challenges: Participate in Capture The Flag competitions.
- Bug Bounty Programs: Start participating in live bug bounty programs.
- Certifications: Consider certifications like OSCP, CEH, or eLearnSecurity certifications.
- Join Communities: Engage with the cybersecurity community through forums, social media, and conferences.

## 11. Advanced Techniques
- Binary Exploitation: Learn about buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, etc.
- Reverse Engineering: Get comfortable with tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, and OllyDbg.
- Malware Analysis: Study common malware techniques and how to analyze malicious code.

## 12. Automating Workflows
- Python & Bash Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks and create custom tools.
- Automated Recon Tools: Use tools like Amass, Sublist3r, and Aquatone.
- Continuous Integration: Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines.

## 13. Real-World Practice
- Private Bug Bounty Programs: Once confident, apply to private programs that offer more challenging environments.
- Advanced Target Recon: Research and select targets with less competition but high value.

## 14. Building a Portfolio
- Writeups: Document your findings and create writeups on platforms like Medium or your blog.
- Public Repos: Share your tools, scripts, and methodologies on GitHub.
- Certifications: Display your certifications and achievements.

## 15. Staying Updated
- Security Feeds: Follow blogs, Twitter accounts, and forums to stay updated with the latest vulnerabilities.
- Conferences & Talks: Attend or watch recordings from conferences like DEFCON, Black Hat, and OWASP.

## Conclusion
Following this roadmap will provide a strong foundation in bug bounty hunting, from basic knowledge to advanced exploitation techniques. Consistency, practice, and community engagement are key to success in this field.
