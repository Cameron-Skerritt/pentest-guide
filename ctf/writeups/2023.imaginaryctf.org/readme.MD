<h3>Idotriot(web)</h3>
After unzipping given source code, saw there is a code to read `/flag.txt`.
We can read it directlythe flag on http://idoriot.chal.imaginaryctf.org/flag.txt

Flag is, `ictf{1ns3cure_direct_object_reference_from_hidden_post_param_i_guess}`
<h3>Idotriot Revenge</h3>
Similar challenge. 
Got source code of the site in zip file. 
After unzipping the file, checked source code. 
There is two condition in the code to print the flag. 
First condition is to add user_id param in url with id number of admin. 
So I assumed user id of the admin is 0 (first number in database series). 
Second condition is to preg match the username with admin. 
Used, admin1337 as username to register to bypass this and opened http://idoriot-revenge.chal.imaginaryctf.org/index.php?user_id=0.

Flag is, `ictf{this_ch4lleng3_creator_1s_really_an_idoriot}`
