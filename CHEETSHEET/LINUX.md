# Automount partition


1 - Write down the UUID of the drive that you want to mount by executing the following command:

`sudo blkid`

2 - Then edit the fstab:

`sudo gedit /etc/fstab`

3 - Add at the end of the file fstab:

`UUID=766576346BD0EF3E /dev/sda4 ntfs defaults 0 0`

Be sure the UUID matches what you recorded in the first step

4 - Restart

That is all. Good Luck.
